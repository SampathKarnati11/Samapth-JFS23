    <!-- Description about cricket -->
    <p><strong>Cricket</strong> is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bat-and-ball_games">bat-and-ball game</a> played between two <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_team">teams</a> of eleven players on a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_field">field</a>, 
        at the centre of which is a 22-yard (20-metre; 66-foot) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_pitch">pitch</a> with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket">wicket</a> at each end, 
        each comprising two <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bail_(cricket)">bails</a> (small sticks) balanced on three <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stump_(cricket)">stumps</a>. Two players from the 
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)">batting</a> team, the striker and nonstriker, stand in front of either wicket holding <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_bat">bats</a>, 
        \while one player from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fielding_(cricket)">fielding</a> team, the bowler, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowling_(cricket)">bowls</a> the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_ball">ball</a> toward the striker's 
        wicket from the opposite end of the pitch. The striker's goal is to hit the bowled ball 
        with the bat and then switch places with the nonstriker, with the batting team scoring one 
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_(cricket)">run</a> for each of these exchanges. Runs are also scored when the ball reaches the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boundary_(cricket)">boundary</a> of 
        the field or when the ball is bowled <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extra_(cricket)#Illegal_deliveries">illegally.</a></p>

    <p>The fielding team aims to prevent runs by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dismissal_(cricket)">dismissing</a> batters (so they are "out"). 
        Dismissal can occur in various ways, including being <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowled">bowled</a> (when the ball hits the 
        striker's wicket and dislodges the bails), and by the fielding side either <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caught">catching</a>
        the ball after it is hit by the bat but <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_out">before</a> it hits the ground, or hitting a wicket 
        with the ball before a batter can cross the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crease_(cricket)">crease line</a> in front of the wicket. When ten 
        batters have been dismissed, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings">innings</a> (playing phase) ends and the teams swap roles. 
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forms_of_cricket">Forms of cricket</a> range from traditional <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_cricket">Test matches</a> played over five days to the newer 
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty20">Twenty20</a> format (also known as T20), in which each team bats for a single innings of 20 
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over_(cricket)">overs</a> (each "over" being a set of 6 fair opportunities for the batting team to score) and 
        the game generally lasts three to four hours.</p>
    
    <p>Traditionally, cricketers play in all-white <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_clothing_and_equipment">kit</a>, but in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limited_overs_cricket">limited overs cricket</a>, they wear club 
        or team colours. In addition to the basic kit, some players wear protective gear to prevent 
        injury caused by the ball, which is a hard, solid spheroid made of compressed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leather">leather</a> with a 
        slightly raised sewn seam enclosing a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cork_(material)">cork</a> core layered with tightly wound string.</p>
    
    <p>The earliest known definite reference to cricket is to it being played in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_East_England">South East England</a> in 
        the mid-16th century. It spread globally with the expansion of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Empire">British Empire</a>, with the first 
        international matches in the second half of the 19th century. The game's governing body is the 
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Cricket_Council">International Cricket Council</a> (ICC), which has over 100 members, twelve of which are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_International_Cricket_Council_members">full members</a>
        who play Test matches. The game's rules, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laws_of_Cricket">Laws of Cricket</a>, are maintained by 
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marylebone_Cricket_Club">Marylebone Cricket Club</a> (MCC) in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London">London</a>. The sport is followed primarily in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Asia">South Asia</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia">Australia</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand">New Zealand</a>, the

    <p>Cricket is one of many games in the "club ball" sphere that involve hitting a ball with a hand-held 
        implement. Others include <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball">baseball</a> (which shares many <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_baseball_and_cricket">similarities</a> with cricket, both belonging 
        in the more specific <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bat-and-ball_games">bat-and-ball games</a> category), 
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf">golf</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hockey">hockey</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis">tennis</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squash_(sport)">squash</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Badminton">badminton</a> 
        and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Table_tennis">table tennis</a>. In cricket's case, a key difference is the existence of a solid target 
        structure, the wicket (originally, it is thought, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket_gate">"wicket gate"</a> through which sheep were 
        herded), that the batter must defend.The cricket historian <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Altham">Harry Altham</a> identified three 
        "groups" of "club ball" games: the "hockey group", in which the ball is driven to and from 
        between two targets (the goals); the "golf group", in which the ball is driven towards an 
        undefended target (the hole); and the "cricket group", in which "the ball is aimed at a mark 
        (the wicket) and driven away from it".</p>
    
    <p>It is generally believed that cricket originated as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_children%27s_games">children's game</a> in the south-eastern 
        counties of England, sometime during the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_in_the_Middle_Ages">medieval period.</a> Although there are claims for 
        prior dates, the earliest definite reference to cricket being played comes from evidence 
        given at a court case in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guildford">Guildford</a> in January 1597 (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Style_and_New_Style_dates">Old Style</a>, equating to January 1598 in 
        the modern calendar). The case concerned ownership of a certain plot of land, and the court 
        heard the testimony of a 59-year-old <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coroner">coroner</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_cricket#First_definite_reference">John Derrick,</a> who gave witness that:</p>

    <p><blockquote>Being a scholler in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Grammar_School,_Guildford">ffree schoole of Guldeford</a> hee and diverse of his fellows did runne and play there at creckett and other plaies.</blockquote></p>

    <p>Given Derrick's age, it was about half a century earlier when he was at school, and so it is 
        certain that cricket was being played c.â€‰1550 by boys in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surrey">Surrey</a>.The view that it was 
        originally a children's game is reinforced by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randle_Cotgrave">Randle Cotgrave's</a> 1611 English-<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_language">French</a> dictionary 
        in which he defined the noun "crosse" as "the crooked staff wherewith boys play at cricket", 
        and the verb form "crosser" as "to play at cricket".</p>
    
    <p>One possible source for the sport's name is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_English">Old English</a> word "cryce" (or "cricc") meaning 
        a crutch or staff. In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_Johnson">Samuel Johnson's</a> Dictionary, he derived cricket from "cryce, Saxon, 
        a stick".In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_French">Old French</a>, the word "criquet" seems to have meant a kind of club or stick. 
        Given the strong medieval trade connections between south-east England and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_of_Flanders">County of Flanders</a> 
        when the latter belonged to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duchy_of_Burgundy">Duchy of Burgundy</a>, the name may have been derived from the Middle 
        Dutch (in use in Flanders at the time) "krick"(-e), meaning a stick (crook). Another possible 
        source is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_Dutch">Middle Dutch</a> word "krickstoel", meaning a long low stool used for kneeling in church 
        that resembled the long low <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket">wicket</a> with two stumps used in early cricket.According to Heiner 
        Gillmeister, a European language expert of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Bonn">Bonn University</a>, "cricket" derives from the Middle Dutch 
        phrase for hockey, "met de (krik ket)sen" ("with the stick chase"). Gillmeister has suggested 
        that not only the name but also the sport itself may be of Flemish origin.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Growth of amateur and professional cricket in England</strong></p>

    <p>Although the main object of the game has always been to score the most <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_(cricket)">runs</a>, the early form of cricket 
       differed from the modern game in certain key technical aspects; the North American variant of cricket 
       known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket_(sport)">wicket</a> retained many of these aspects.The ball was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Underarm_bowling">bowled underarm</a> by the bowler and along 
       the ground towards a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)">batter</a> armed with a bat that in shape resembled a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hockey_stick">hockey stick</a>; the batter defended 
       a low, two-stump wicket; and runs were called notches because the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scorer">scorers</a> recorded them by notching tally 
       sticks.</p>
